# bmme_890_schaefer

This is a practice repository for Dr. Giovanni's 890 BMME class. 
An example text file has been added. 
I will edit a branch while noah edits it as well.

HW2a:
I made a python notebook doing exploratory visualization on the titanic dataset from Kaggle.

HW2B:
I made a copy of lecture 5 recap in my directory. I added code to calculate
the inner product of two column vectors, as well as the outer product
by four loop and by @ symbol.
