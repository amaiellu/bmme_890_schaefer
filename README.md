# bmme_890_schaefer

This is a practice repository for Dr. Giovanni's 890 BMME class. 
An example text file has been added. 
I will edit a branch while noah edits it as well.

HW2a:
I made a python notebook doing exploratory visualization on the titanic dataset from Kaggle.

HW2B:
I made a copy of lecture 5 recap in my directory. I added code to calculate
the inner product of two column vectors, as well as the outer product
by four loop and by @ symbol.

Update to Hw2B: previous notebook was erroneous. I have now made a copy 
of the correct homework file, and added my code to each exercise. 

Hw4: 
Added python notebook used to create models for titanic Kaggle 
competition

Hw5: 
Added python notebook used to create models for housing regression Kaggle competition

HW6: Added Spike sorting HW

HW7: Added neural network HW

Final Project: Added various notebooks used to train models for final presentation. Reorganized hws into folders
